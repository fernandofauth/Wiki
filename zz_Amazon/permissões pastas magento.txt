Here's how to do this via your SSH client. Log in to your SSH account and then execute the following commands:

cd to magento install
find . -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;
chmod 666 downloader/config.ini
You should now be able to access the Magento Connect Manager. When you have finished the installation/upgrade, you should reset the permissions by executing the following SSH commands:

find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
chmod o+w var media app/etc/use_cache.ser
