yum install mysql 
yum install mysql-server 
yum install mysql-devel 
chgrp -R mysql /var/lib/mysql 
chmod -R 770 /var/lib/mysql 
service mysqld start 

It states in the ouptut of the last command to copy and paste mysql.server into the appropriate runlevel area for your install. 

I can't find the file mysql.server on the machine anywhere. Anyone know where it is or how to proceed? 

It also states to set the passwords for your root account like so 

/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password ';Thpnh]aIR#I'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h hostname password ';Thpnh]aIR#I'

/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password ;Thpnh]aIR#I

wadmin
;Thpnh]aIR#I
